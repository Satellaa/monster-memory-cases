  - question: |
      If a monster battles while **Ancient Forest** is face-up on the field,
      but that monster is then flipped face-down before the end of the Battle
      Phase, will that monster be destroyed by the effect of **Ancient Forest**?
    answer: |
      Even if a monster is flipped face-down after having battled, it will
      still be destroyed by the effect of **Ancient Forest** at the end of the
      Battle Phase.
