  - question: |
      After **Infernoid Harmadik** declared an attack, it was flipped
      face-down by the effect of **Book of Moon**. During Main Phase 2 of that
      turn, if **Ceasefire"** is activated and that **Infernoid Harmadik**
      becomes face-up, can its effect『Once per turn: You can
      target 1 monster on the field; destroy it. This card cannot attack the
      turn you activate this effect』be activated?
    answer: |
      Even if the **Infernoid Harmadik** that declared an attack this turn was
      later flipped to face-down defense position and then returned to face-up
      position, since that **Infernoid Harmadik** has already declared an
      attack, its effect『Once per turn: You can target 1 monster
      on the field; destroy it. This card cannot attack the turn you activate
      this effect』cannot be activated.
