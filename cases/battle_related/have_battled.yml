      My **Krystal Dragon** attacked my opponent's face-down Defense
      Position monster. If that face-down Defense Position monster was
      **Tsukuyomi**, and **Tsukuyomi's** monster effect『If this card is Normal
      Summoned or flipped face-up: Target 1 face-up monster on the field; change
      that target to face-down Defense Position.』is activated, changing my
      **Krystal Dragon** to face-down Defense Position, can the monster effect
      of that **Krystal Dragon**『Once per turn, during your Battle Step, if this
      card battled this turn: You can add 1 Level 8 Dragon-Type monster from
      your Deck to your hand.』be activated?
    answer: |
      In that situation, if the **Krystal Dragon** that battled is in
      face-down Defense Position, its monster effect cannot be activated.

      (Even if **Ceasefire** is later activated during that turn's Battle Step and that **Krystal Dragon** is flipped face-up, its monster effect still cannot be activated.)
