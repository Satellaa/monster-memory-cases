      My **Crackdown**, targeting a face-up monster in my opponent's Monster
      Zone, resolves, and I gain control of that monster. That targeted monster
      is then later changed to face-down Defense Position. What happens to
      **Crackdown**'s effect?
    answer: |
      If the monster is flipped face-down after **Crackdown** has resolved,
      **Crackdown** stops targeting that monster.

      Therefore,『take control of that monster』stops applying, **and control of the monster returns to your opponent.** Additionally, since『while you control that monster, it cannot attack or activate effects』stops applying, the monster will be able to attack, and its effects can be activated.

      **Crackdown** will remain face-up in the Spell & Trap Zone without a target, and thus『when that monster leaves the field, destroy this card』will also no longer apply.

  - question: |
      If a monster equipped with **Graydle Alligator**, **Graydle Cobra** or
      **Graydle Eagle** is changed to face-down Defense Position, what happens
      to the『While this card is equipped to a monster by this effect, take
      control of that monster. When this card leaves the field, destroy the
      equipped monster.』effect that is applied?
    answer: |
      Since that monster cannot be equipped with Equip Cards anymore,
      **Graydle Alligator** (etc.) is destroyed. In that case, since at that
      time the monster is no longer being targeted by **Graydle Alligator**
      (etc.), the monster is not destroyed by the『when this card leaves the
      field, destroy the equipped monster』effect.

      Also,『take control of that monster』stops applying, **and control of it returns to your opponent.**
