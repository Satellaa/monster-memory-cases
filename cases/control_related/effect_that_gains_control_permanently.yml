      I have gained control of a monster by the effect of **Number 11: Big
      Eye**. (i.e., an effect that lets me permanently gain control of the
      monster). That monster is then banished, and returned to the field, by the
      effect of **Interdimensional Matter Forwarder**. What happens to the
      monster?
    answer: |
      **You retain control of the monster.** For effects such as that of
      **Number 11: Big Eye**, which do not have a time limit for which you gain
      control of the monster, **control will not return to your opponent even if
      the card is banished temporarily.**

  - question: |
      I activated **Magic Gate of Miracles** and took control of my
      opponent's **Stardust Dragon**. Afterward, if **Book of Moon** is
      activated and that **Stardust Dragon** is changed to face-down Defense
      Position, which effects of **Magic Gate of Miracles** will be applied?
    answer: |
      Even if a monster you took control of with the effect of **Magic Gate of
      Miracles** is changed to face-down Defense Position, as in this scenario,
      **control of that monster does not return to your opponent**, however the
      effect that prevents that monster from being destroyed by battle no longer
      applies.
